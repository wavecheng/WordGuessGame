# Word Guess Game #
It is a PowerShell script to generate PowerPoint files with random words from corpus for the "someone acts, someone guesses the word/sentence" (你比我猜). You can specific the corpus location and output file location and word count during the generation. 

It use the [THUOCL：清华大学开放中文词库](http://thuocl.thunlp.org/) corpus as default data source. 
Sample command:

```.\generate.ps1 -FilePath .\data\THUOCL_chengyu.txt -Size 50 -OutputFile test.pptx ```

`template.pptx` needs to be put in current direcotry as PS execution will not recognize current file location. It will throw "FileNotFound" exception. We need to provide the full file path for the template
